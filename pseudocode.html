// WHEN I scroll down
// THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours  

// WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
// THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

// Use the time for above: NOW
//Get the time from each time block, convert to real time and compare to current time.
    //Convert Hours block to time
    //Compare time to block (moment)
    //Loop through each section of hours and fill in according to time
    //Color code the sections accordingly

//Create array to store in local storage
    //schedule = (time , task)
    //store to array
    //var storedSchedule = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('Schedule')) || [];

//Allow for input event / to be captured and stored
    //We need to use JSON.stringify to turn the list from an array into a string

//Events populate list according to hour with events.

//Events can be edited by clicking on a time slot or the button next to it

//Events can be saved in it's time slot and persist on page desipite page reloading
